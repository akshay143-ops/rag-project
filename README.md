# RAG Learning App

A Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) application built with Python, ChromaDB, SentenceTransformers, and Google Gemini. You'll build this incrementally over Weeks 10–15.

## What This App Does

You can ask this app questions about Python, machine learning, databases, APIs, and AI concepts. It finds the most relevant documents from its knowledge base and sends them to Gemini as context — so the answers are grounded in real information rather than guesswork.

## Setup

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone <repo-url>
cd student-rag-project
```

### 2. Create a virtual environment
```bash
python -m venv venv
```

Activate it:
- **Mac/Linux:** `source venv/bin/activate`
- **Windows:** `venv\Scripts\activate`

### 3. Install dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Set up your Gemini API key

Copy the example environment file:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Open `.env` and replace `your-gemini-api-key-here` with your actual key.

### 5. Run the app
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

The app opens in your browser at `http://localhost:8501`.

## Assignment: Week 10 — Run the Starter App

**Learning objective:** Understand how a basic RAG pipeline works end-to-end.

### Background

RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) connects a vector database to an LLM. Instead of asking the LLM to answer from memory (which leads to hallucination), we first *retrieve* relevant documents from our knowledge base, then *augment* the LLM's prompt with those documents so it can generate a *grounded* answer.

This week, everything is already built. Your job is to run it, understand how the pieces fit together, and answer the reflection questions below.

### What to do

1. Follow the Setup instructions above and get the app running
2. Ask the app at least 3 questions — try both on-topic and off-topic questions
3. Read through these four files and make sure you understand what each one does:
   - `data_loader.py` — where does the knowledge base come from?
   - `embeddings.py` — what does `embed_text()` return, and why?
   - `vector_store.py` — what does ChromaDB store, and how does `query_similar()` work?
   - `rag_pipeline.py` — trace a question from `run_rag()` all the way to a returned answer

### Reflection questions (be ready to discuss in class)

- What would happen if you asked a question that no document in the knowledge base covers?
- Why do we store vector embeddings instead of just the original text?
- What is the difference between keyword search and semantic search?

### ✅ When done
Check off **Week 10** in the Weekly Progress section above, then delete this entire Week 10 assignment section (from `## Assignment: Week 10` down to the next `---`).
